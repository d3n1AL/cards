Card Sorting Simulator created for my Science Education Internship at the Science Museum of Virginia for the Summer of 2021

Original intent was to create an environment that I could use to animate and explain sorting algorithms, with users having the ability to "race" computers by toggling the algorithm used and various delays

While I was relatively successful in implementing the user side, I was unable to figure out how to safely animate the computer side of the animations, likely due to issues with threading in Swing (again, I am only a first-year CS student with little to no coding experience)

Additionally, the ImageIO code needs to be edited such that it works in any project folder, not the absolute pathing I used when trying to run it on my computer. 

As you can probably tell, this project is by no means complete, but given that I only have two more weeks left in the summer, I figured I should upload as it is to at least document the work I went through to get up to this point. (again, haven't really learned git or github well so I'm sure it would've been much smarter to do this earlier but it is what it is)

Most if not all of this code was inspired or taken wholesale from various assignments in my CS2110 class at UVA taken in Spring of 2021. Please feel free to use this code as you please, otherwise thank you for looking it over.
